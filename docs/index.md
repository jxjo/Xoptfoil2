# The Airfoil Optimizer 
{: .fs-9 }

Optimize an airfoil based on its aerodynamic characteristics. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Xoptfoil2 follows an approach to airfoil design that could be called 'design by polars' - in contrast to the classic design methods such as 'inverse design' or 'direct design'. 

A new, optimized airfoil is described by its aerodynamic properties with objectives at some operating points. The optimizer will try to design an airfoil geometry which satisfies these objectives best possible.  

Xoptfoil2 was already used to develop some high end [airfoil families](https://github.com/jxjo/Airfoils) for F3B/F3F model gliders.

## About the project

Xoptfoil2 is the successor of the awesome Xoptfoil by Daniel Prosser and [Xoptfoil-JX](https://github.com/jxjo/Xoptfoil-JX/tree/master), a branch of the original Xoptfoil. The objectives of the project are:
- building a robust and reliable airfoil optimization kernel supporting future extensions in various aspects. 
- an airfoil optimizer GUI, which allows to define, visualize and analyze an optimization task - WiP
