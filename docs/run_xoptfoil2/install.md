## Installation 
{: .no_toc }

The actual version of Xoptfoil2 can be found in the [Releases section](https://github.com/jxjo/Xoptfoil2/releases) of the Xoptfoil2 Github repo. In 'Assets' there some zip files: 
- a ready build version for Windows 
- the source files for building Xoptfoil2 under Linux

<span>Windows</span>{: .label .label-blue } 

Download the Windows zip-file and extract it in any subdirectory - maybe for the first tries directly on the Windows Desktop. Xoptfoil2 is a very lightweight installation, which doesn't install any other artefacts on your PC.

If you just want to try the examples, go to the folder `.\examples`, select an example and double click on `make.bat`.

Your own optimization projects should be created in seperate directories. Extend the Windows `Path` environment variable with the path to folder Xoptfoil2 was installed. Then you don't need to copy `Xoptfoil2.exe`each time you create a new project.
