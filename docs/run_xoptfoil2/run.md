# Run Xoptfoil2

The optimizer is started as a shell command with command line arguments. The optimization task is defined with an input file which provides Xoptfoil2 with all information needed. 

A minimum start command would look like this: 

```
   Xoptfoil2  myCase.inp  
```
Once an optimization is started there is only limited possibility to end an optimization normally including the creation of a “final” airfoil. 

See the following sections for more details.
